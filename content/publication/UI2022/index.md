abstract: Recent theoretical and methodological advances in activity space and big data provide new opportunities to study socio-spatial segregation. This review first provides an overview of the literature in terms of measurements, spatial patterns, underlying causes, and social consequences of spatial segregation. These studies are mainly place-centred and static, ignoring the segregation experience across various activity spaces due to the dynamism of movements. In response to this challenge, we highlight the work in progress toward a new paradigm for segregation studies. Specifically, this review presents how and the extent to which activity space methods can advance segregation research from a people-based perspective. It explains the requirements of mobility-based methods for quantifying the dynamics of segregation due to high movement within the urban context. It then discusses and illustrates a dynamic and multi-dimensional framework to show how big data can enhance understanding segregation by capturing individualsâ€™ spatio-temporal behaviours. The review closes with new directions and challenges for segregation research using big data.
